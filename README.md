# LittleBits Project

## Overview

The LittleBits project provides a lightweight and efficient C++ library designed for managing configuration settings. It leverages modern C++ features, such as templates, `std::array`, and `std::atomic`, to ensure type safety, thread safety, and ease of use. The library is particularly suited for applications that require dynamic configuration management with minimal overhead.

## Features

- **Type Safety**: Utilizes templates to ensure that configuration values are of the correct type.
- **Thread Safety**: Uses `std::atomic` for thread-safe read and write operations on configuration values.
- **Efficiency**: Designed with performance in mind, making minimal use of resources.
- **Ease of Use**: Provides a simple and intuitive API for managing configuration settings.

## Requirements

- C++17 or higher
- A modern C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC)

## Installation

To include LittleBits in your project, simply add the `littlebits.h` header file to your project's include path. There is no need to compile any source files or link against any libraries, as LittleBits is a header-only library.

## Usage

### Creating an Instance

You can create an instance of `littlebits` with default configurations:

```cpp
littlebits config;
